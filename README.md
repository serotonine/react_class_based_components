# React Class-based components

https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25599690#notes

Although the Functional components are the most recent and commun way to build components you could face the Class based components (React version < 16.8).

```
class Product extends Component {
    render(){
        return <h1>My products</h1>
    }
}
```

**class-based components cannot use React Hooks**
